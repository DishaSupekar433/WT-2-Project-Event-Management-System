In the fast-paced world of event management, staying organized, efficient, and customer-centric is paramount to success. To streamline the entire event management process and provide a seamless experience for both event organizers and attendees, an Event Management System built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) stack has been developed. This system incorporates a wide range of features that cater to the diverse needs of event organizers and users, ensuring a smooth and hassle-free event planning and execution experience.
